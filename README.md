# elm-zip

Work with ZIP archives without leaving Elm.

At this point, this library can only read archives, I'm currently working on writing archives too.

See [the `Zip` module documentation](http://package.elm-lang.org/packages/agu-z/elm-zip/latest/Zip) to learn how to use it.

## Acknowledgements

Thanks to [folkertdev](https://github.com/folkertdev) for writing [elm-flate](https://package.elm-lang.org/packages/folkertdev/elm-flate/latest/).

This would've taken considerably longer if I had to write the compression algorithm too ☺️
